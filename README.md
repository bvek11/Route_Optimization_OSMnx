# Route-Optimization-Using-OSMnx
The "Geospatial Analysis and Route Optimization Project Using OSMnx" explores urban transportation in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, using the OSMnx library to analyze road networks and optimize travel routes. It employs geospatial techniques, the  Nearest Neighbor algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and visualization tools to enhance route planning for tourists, with potential future improvements like real-time traffic integration and mapping APIs.
