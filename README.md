# Route-Optimization-Using-OSMnx
Route Optimization Using OSMnx uses OSMnx for road network extraction, GeoDataFrame conversion, and route optimization using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm for TSP. It applies the Haversine formula for distance calculation, NetworkX for shortest path analysis, and geocoding for node identification to determine optimal routes.
